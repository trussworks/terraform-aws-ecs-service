Terraform module that creates an ECS service with the following features

* Runs an ECS service with or without an AWS load balancer.
* Stream logs to a CloudWatch log group encrypted with a KMS key.
* Associate multiple target groups with Network Load Balancers (NLB) and Application Load Balancers (ALB).
* Supports running ECS tasks on EC2 instances or Fargate.

## Default container definition (hello world app)

We create an initial task definition using the `golang:alpine` image as a way
to validate the initial infrastructure is working: visiting the site shows
a simple Go hello world page listening on two configurable ports. This is
meant to get a proof of concept instance up and running and to help with
testing.

If you want to customize the listener ports for the hello world app, you can
modify the `hello_world_container_ports` variable.

In production usage, we expect deployment tooling to manage the container
definitions going forward, not Terraform.

## Upgrade Path

### 2.x.x to 3.0.0

In 3.0.0 the module added support for multiple load balancer target groups. To support this change, `container_port`, `container_health_check_port` and `lb_target_group` are being replaced with `lb_target_groups`

#### Without a load balancer

If you are using this module without an ALB or NLB then you can remove any references to `container_port`, `container_health_check_port` and `lb_target_group` if you were doing so.

#### Using with ALB or NLB target groups

If you are using an NLB or NLB target groups with this module then you will need replace the values of `container_port`, `container_health_check_port` and `lb_target_group` with

Below is an example of how the module would be instantiated prior to version 3.0.0

```hcl
module "app_ecs_service" {
  source = "trussworks/ecs-service/aws"
  ...
  container_port                  = 8443
  container_health_check_port     = 8080
  lb_target_group_arn             = module.alb.arn
  ...
}
```

In 3.0.0 the same example will look like the following

```hcl
module "app_ecs_service" {
  source = "trussworks/ecs-service/aws"
  ...
  lb_target_groups =
  [
    {
      container_port                  = 8443
      container_health_check_port     = 8080
      lb_target_group_arn             = module.alb.arn
    }
  ]
  ...
}
```


### 2.0.0 to 2.1.0

In 2.1.0 KMS log encryption is required by default. This requires that you create and attach a new AWS KMS key ARN.
As an example here is how to set that up (please review on your own):

```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "cloudwatch_logs_allow_kms" {
  statement {
    sid    = "Enable IAM User Permissions"
    effect = "Allow"

    principals {
      type = "AWS"
      identifiers = [
        "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:root",
      ]
    }

    actions = [
      "kms:*",
    ]
    resources = ["*"]
  }

  statement {
    sid    = "Allow logs KMS access"
    effect = "Allow"

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["logs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"]
    }

    actions = [
      "kms:Encrypt*",
      "kms:Decrypt*",
      "kms:ReEncrypt*",
      "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
      "kms:Describe*"
    ]
    resources = ["*"]
  }
}

resource "aws_kms_key" "main" {
  description         = "Key for ECS log encryption"
  enable_key_rotation = true

  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.cloudwatch_logs_allow_kms.json
}
```

**NOTE:** Best practice is to use a separate KMS key per ECS Service. Do not re-use KMS keys if it can be avoided.

### 1.15.0 to 2.0.0

v2.0.0 of this module is built against Terraform v0.12. In addition to
requiring this upgrade, the v1.15.0 version of the module took the name
of the ECS cluster as a parameter; v2.0.0 takes the actual object of the
ECS cluster as a parameter instead. You will need to update previous
instances of this module with the altered parameter.

## Developer Setup

Install dependencies (macOS)

```shell
brew install pre-commit go terraform terraform-docs
```

### Testing

[Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) is being used for
automated testing with this module. Tests in the `test` folder can be run
locally by running the following command:

```text
make test
```

Or with aws-vault:

```text
AWS_VAULT_KEYCHAIN_NAME=<NAME> aws-vault exec <PROFILE> -- make test
```
