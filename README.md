Creates an ECS service.

Creates the following resources:

* CloudWatch log group.
* Security Groups for the ECS service.
* ECS service.
* Task definition using `golang:1.12.5-alpine` (see below).
* Configurable associations with Network Load Balancers (NLB) and Application Load Balancers (ALB).

We create an initial task definition using the `golang:1.12.5-alpine` image as a way
to validate the initial infrastructure is working: visiting the site shows
a simple Go hello world page. We expect deployments to manage the container
definitions going forward, not Terraform.

## Terraform Versions

Terraform 0.12. Pin module version to ~> 2.0.1. Submit pull-requests to master branch.

Terraform 0.11. Pin module version to ~> 1.14.0. Submit pull-requests to terraform011 branch.

## Usage

### ECS service associated with an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

```hcl
module "app_ecs_service" {
  source = "trussworks/ecs-service/aws"

  name        = "app"
  environment = "prod"

  ecs_cluster                   = aws_ecs_cluster.mycluster
  ecs_vpc_id                    = module.vpc.vpc_id
  ecs_subnet_ids                = module.vpc.private_subnets
  tasks_desired_count           = 2
  tasks_minimum_healthy_percent = 50
  tasks_maximum_percent         = 200

  associate_alb      = true
  alb_security_group = module.security_group.id
  lb_target_group    = module.target_group.id
}
```

### ECS Service associated with a Network Load Balancer(NLB)

```hcl
module "app_ecs_service" {
  source = "trussworks/ecs-service/aws"

  name        = "app"
  environment = "prod"

  ecs_cluster                   = aws_ecs_cluster.mycluster
  ecs_vpc_id                    = module.vpc.vpc_id
  ecs_subnet_ids                = module.vpc.private_subnets
  tasks_desired_count           = 2
  tasks_minimum_healthy_percent = 50
  tasks_maximum_percent         = 200

  associate_nlb          = true
  nlb_subnet_cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/24", "10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
  lb_target_group   = module.target_group.id
}
```

## Upgrade Path

### 1.15.0 to 2.0.0

v2.0.0 of this module is built against Terraform v0.12. In addition to
requiring this upgrade, the v1.15.0 version of the module took the name
of the ECS cluster as a parameter; v2.0.0 takes the actual object of the
ECS cluster as a parameter instead. You will need to update previous
instances of this module with the altered parameter.
